# My ARM Scripts
 This is my personal collection of scripts related to ARM (AArch64) software adaption & development. Primary aim here is to record the scripts I used in my experiments so that I would not need to repeat them in the shell. These are presented to you with absolutely no guarantee whatsoever about their usability, performance or even correctness, and I take no responability if you bricked your device somehow using these. It's advised to review the actual commands before execution. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
